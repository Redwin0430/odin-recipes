        <h2>Turkey Protein Omlette</h2>
        <p>The turkey omlette is a staple in my protein intake of the day. Coming in at around 360 calories and 35 grams of protein, I typically ate it once a day on my weight loss
            journey in 2024. The omlette is fairly simple to make as it only requires a few ingredients and a little bit of time. Although its called the breakfast omlette, I
            typically made it the most for dinner instead of breakfast.
