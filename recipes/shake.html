        <h2>Simple Protein Shake</h2>
        <p>The protein shake is a staple in my protein intake of the day. Coming in at around 300 calories and 44 grams of protein, I typically drink the shake once a day
            since I started doing calisthenics back in 2021. The protein shake is fairly simple to make as it only requires a few ingredients and a little bit of time.
            Should be able to make in about 5 minutes which makes it the perfect quick and filling snack.
